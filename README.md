# hello-world
Hello. It's me.

I was wondering if after all these years should like to meet. To go over everything. They say the time suppose to heal ya but I ain't much healing.



Helloooooo. Can you hear me? I'm in California dreaming about we were used to be. ......I forgotten how we felt before the wolrd fell at out feet.
